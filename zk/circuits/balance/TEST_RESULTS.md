## Summary

We tested Component A by:
1. ✅ Creating test data with proper Merkle tree structure
2. ✅ Verifying Merkle proof calculations
3. ✅ Validating circuit logic and constraints
4. ⏳ Awaiting circom compiler for full proof generation

**Recent Update:** Added `client_id` public input to match paper specification of per-client dataset proofs.
