# Verifiable-Federated-Training-with-Zero-Knowledge-Proofs-ZK-FL-
Privacy-preserving ML across multiple organizations: no raw data sharing, secure aggregation of updates, and zero-knowledge proofs that (1) data distributions satisfy agreed constraints, (2) training steps follow clipped-SGD on committed batches, and (3) the final model meets fairness thresholds â€” all verifiable by a third party.
